# Day 1 Python Project

##  Project Description
This project contains the Python code I wrote on **Day 1** while learning Python.  
It’s mainly about getting comfortable with the basics — understanding syntax, writing simple logic, and seeing how things actually work in code.

This is the starting point of my Python learning journey and sets the foundation for more advanced topics ahead.
